Search Value,		Linear Search(kbytes),		Binary Search (kbytes),		Fibonacci Sequence (kbytes)		Notes
1,			2244,			        2296,			        2304,					Allocated memory is different as linear search requires least memory likely because there are less calculations and stores less variables during the process compared to binary and fibonacci algorithms			
4,			2124,				2224,				2260,					Allocated memory is different but relatively similar. Fibonacci has one of the lowest time complexities but linear search takes least space.
22,			2204,				2248,				2124,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Binary search has a fast runtime but fibonacci search takes least memory.
37,			2240,				2228,				2260,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Binary search has least memory.
22906,			2248,				2212,				2256,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Binary search has least memory while they all have similar runtime.
53757,			2260,				2212,				2232,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Binary has least memory usage.	
112591,			2216,				2252,				2204,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Fibonacci has least memory and they all have same runtime.  
361940,			2124,				2204,				2260,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. However, linear uses least memory but binary has fastest runtime.
475713,			2128,				2256,				2208,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Linear takes least space while fibonacci takes least time.
893766,			2256,				2256,				2224,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Fibonacci has least memory while they take the same time to run. 
996637,			2220,				2304,				2248,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Linear search has least memory but fibonacci has fastest runtime 
996639,			2224,				2304,				2304,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. Linear search takes least memory. 
996652,			2196,				2240,				2228,					Allocated memory is different in this case
-996652,		2228,				2236,				2224,					Allocated memory is different in this case for similar reasons. However fibonacci sequence has the least memory when i expected it to be linear as the element is not in the array.
